# Instagram-Logger
Timestamp, username, etc of posts, stories, and activities gets logged as you browse Instagram on the web client. Made especially for lurkers who wants to get some insights.

Logs Instagram posts and stories into IndexedDB and exports to JSON. No coding needed for use because there is a GUI.

Info: Some stuff will no longer work on July 31, 2018 because of changes in Instagram's API. On their roadmap even more will be removed. In a few years you can basically do nothing. https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/01/30/instagram-graph-api-updates/ Some data can be exported from a zip file in account settings and you therefore don't need an app/api, such as self following/ers to determine fans and nonfollowbackers. But some is hard to get like what is being logged here.
